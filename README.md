**Plantify** is a modern online plant shopping platform where users can explore plants, add them to cart or wishlist, place orders, and track them. The platform also includes a powerful **Admin Dashboard** to manage plants, orders, and users.

> ⚠️ **Note:** The initial load may take **40–50 seconds**, because the backend is hosted on Render’s free tier, which sleeps after 15 minutes of inactivity.
